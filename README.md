{{ # liberis_automation using C# Selenium with Specflow }}

THESE ARE THE FOLLOWING STEPS I HAVE PERFORMED IN THIS AUTOMATION TESTING :-
  1) I have logged in into https://www.liberis.com/ - using Chrome browser.
  2) From there I have verified it by using its Title of it.
  3) Once verified I clicked on the "Get a demo" button and have tried shifting to the Partner Selection Page.
  4) I have verified that the user is on "become-a-partner" page. URL for that (https://www.liberis.com/become-a-partner)
  5) Then the next step was to validate that :-
     it should validate the message when user does not make a partner selection and click ‘Get a demo’ button
  6) After verifying that the radio button was not checked
  7) Then I clicked on the radio button and made a submit request 

These are the complete task that was asked from me.
